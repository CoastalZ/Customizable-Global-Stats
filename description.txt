Customizable Global Stats is a mod, that allows you to customize the values of player stats.
Here are the stats you can customize:
-Health
-Health Regen Speed
-Defense
-Damage Reduction
-Armor Penetration
-Damage
-Mana
-Mana Cost
-Mana Regen Speed
-Movement,Attack,Mining and Jump speed
-Tile and Wall placement speed
-Jump Height
-Crit Chance
-Max Minions
-Max Sentries
-Wing Fly Time
-Tile and Wall placement range

Everything is changeable in from -10000 (some percent values and few options can be lowered by only -100 bc they break) up to 10000000 in config.
If you set the value to for ex. -10 the weapon damage is going to be reduced by it (Zenith would have 180 bc 190-10=180)
You don't need a reload after changes.

You can also set/multiply the stats

Suggest some new variables to add in comments. I will try to look into them.
